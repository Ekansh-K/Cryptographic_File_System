# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Encrypted File System (EFS) is a custom virtual drive solution that provides encryption, integrity verification, and secure file sharing capabilities. The system creates encrypted containers that mount as regular drives on the operating system, allowing users to store sensitive data with multiple layers of protection including file-level encryption, container-level encryption, cryptographic hashing for tamper detection, and optional steganography features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to create encrypted virtual drives that appear as normal drives in my operating system, so that I can store sensitive files with transparent encryption/decryption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new encrypted container THEN the system SHALL generate a new encrypted file that can be mounted as a virtual drive
2. WHEN a user mounts an encrypted container THEN the system SHALL prompt for authentication credentials and mount the container as a standard drive letter
3. WHEN a user accesses files in the mounted drive THEN the system SHALL automatically decrypt files on read and encrypt files on write
4. WHEN a user unmounts the drive THEN the system SHALL securely close all file handles and dismount the virtual drive

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user handling highly sensitive data, I want multiple layers of encryption protection, so that my data remains secure even if one encryption layer is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is stored in the encrypted container THEN the system SHALL apply file-level AES-256 encryption with unique keys per file
2. WHEN the container is created THEN the system SHALL apply container-level encryption using a separate master key
3. WHEN encryption keys are generated THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random number generation
4. WHEN a user provides a password THEN the system SHALL derive encryption keys using PBKDF2 with at least 100,000 iterations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user concerned about data integrity, I want cryptographic verification of my files, so that I can detect any unauthorized tampering or corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is written to the encrypted container THEN the system SHALL generate and store a SHA-256 hash of the original file content
2. WHEN a file is read from the encrypted container THEN the system SHALL verify the file integrity against its stored hash
3. WHEN file tampering is detected THEN the system SHALL alert the user and prevent access to the corrupted file
4. WHEN the container is accessed THEN the system SHALL verify the container's overall integrity using a master hash

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who needs to share specific files securely, I want to grant selective access to individual files or folders, so that I can collaborate without exposing my entire encrypted drive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects files for sharing THEN the system SHALL create a separate encrypted package with its own access credentials
2. WHEN sharing credentials are provided to another user THEN they SHALL be able to access only the shared files, not the entire container
3. WHEN shared access is revoked THEN the system SHALL invalidate the sharing credentials and prevent further access
4. WHEN files are shared THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs of access attempts and successful authentications
5.(optional) BlueTooth File Tranfer

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user requiring maximum security, I want steganography options to hide my encrypted data, so that the existence of sensitive information is concealed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN steganography mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL embed encrypted container data within innocent-looking files (images, documents)
2. WHEN a steganographic container is created THEN the system SHALL ensure the carrier file remains functional and appears unmodified
3. WHEN accessing steganographic data THEN the system SHALL extract and decrypt the hidden container without affecting the carrier file
4. WHEN steganographic embedding is performed THEN the system SHALL use LSB (Least Significant Bit) techniques or similar methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic key rotation capabilities, so that encryption keys are regularly updated to maintain security over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a key rotation schedule is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically generate new encryption keys at specified intervals
2. WHEN keys are rotated THEN the system SHALL re-encrypt all data with new keys while maintaining access to old data during transition
3. WHEN key rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL securely delete old keys after successful re-encryption
4. WHEN key rotation fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous keys and alert the user of the failure

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user working with the encrypted file system, I want a user-friendly interface for managing containers and settings, so that I can easily perform common operations without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a management interface showing available containers and their status
2. WHEN a user wants to create a container THEN the system SHALL provide a wizard with options for size, encryption settings, and steganography
3. WHEN a user manages existing containers THEN the system SHALL allow mounting, unmounting, resizing, and integrity checking operations
4. WHEN system operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators and status messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security-focused user, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can track access patterns and detect potential security breaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any container operation is performed THEN the system SHALL log the operation with timestamp, user, and operation details
2. WHEN authentication attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log both successful and failed attempts with source information
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert the user and optionally lock the container
4. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL encrypt log files and provide secure log viewing capabilities
